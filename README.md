This Python script implements a simple quiz game with four questions, each worth 10 marks. The give_options function displays multiple-choice options for each question. Users are prompted to answer the questions, and their responses are checked against the correct answers. The script calculates the score based on the number of correct answers and provides feedback based on the total score. To play the quiz, run the script, and input "yes" when asked if you're ready. The script will then display questions with multiple-choice answers and evaluate your responses. At the end, it prints out your total score and a corresponding message based on your performance.
